# Revision 12


Instructions
============
nop           No Operation
mov R/I R     Move(Copy)
rmc R/I       Change current address of RAM
rmv R/I       Change value of RAM on current address
swp R R       Swap register values
jmp R/L       Jump to label, Stack and/or RAM addresses
slp R/I       Sleep (Differs from each implementation)
exb bb        Set Execute Conditional Bool
add R/I       Add ACC
sub R/I       Subtract ACC
mul R/I       Multiply ACC
div R/I       Divide ACC
neg           Toggle signed

xor R/I       XOR bitwise on ACC
lsf R/I       Left Shift ACC
rsf R/I       Right Shift ACC
psh R/L R/I   Push Stack. Address or Label and value. Sets Execute Byte to FALSE if cannot push
psh R/I       Push Stack. Store current address and store specified value. Sets Execute Byte to FALSE if cannot push
pop           Pop Stack. Sets Execute Byte to FALSE if cannot pop
cal L        Store address to IDX then jump to label
ret           Return to IDX
teq R/I R/I   Test Equality. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tgt R/I R/I   Test Greater Than. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tlt R/I R/I   Test Less Than. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tcp R/I R/I   Test Compare. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tdf bb        Test Defined Flag. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
sdf bb        Set Defined Flag


Registers
=========
ACC           Accumulator - All arithmethic and logic operations are done against it and also results stored.
DAT           Data - General purpose register. 
SAV           Save - General purpose register.
STA           Top Stack Level Address Register - Top level of stack is peeked here.
STD           Top Stack Level Data Register - Top level of stack is peeked here.
IDX           Index - Address oriented register store. Can also store data.
RMD           RAM Address Register - Read Only register. Reveals current address.
RMA           RAM Data Register - Read Only register. Reveals data from current address in RAM.
PRC           Program Counter - Read Only register. Shows current ROM address.


Intermediate Values
===================
Intermediate values are signed values ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
It is Int32 signed.


(Execute) Bool
==============
00 DEFAULT    Runs whichever execute bit is set to
01 TRUE       Runs instruction if execute bit and instruction's execute bit are equal
02 FALSE      Runs instruction if execute bit and instruction's execute bit are equal

This also applies to flags

# Execute bit is TRUE
+ nop # Runs
  nop # Runs
- nop # Will not run

# Execute bit is FALSE
+ nop # Will not run
  nop # Runs
- nop # Runs

The Execute Bit will never have the value of DEFAULT.
