# Revision 9 C.C rev12

Codename: Electric Amethyst v2.1

STATUS: NOT FINISHED


Amethyst 2.1 info
=================
The Amethyst 2.0 Assembly and bytecode is a huge improvement from 1.0
 It simplifies RAM accessing, adding powerful indexes.

Instead of TEQ loops and cal-ret's to check updates on a specific port, an internal interrupt handler
 makes code writing easier and performance faster. By adding Label ":INTERRUPT", everytime the
 interrupt is signalled, it jumps to that label. RET now returns to the interrupt address(if from
 an interrupt)


New Features
============

 * Interrupts
 * Simplier parsing
 * Simplified RAM accesses


Argument Symbols
================
$00		Intermediate Number
*00		Intermediate Address
^!IDX	Pointer Dereference. Treat Register Address as Data Register. Contents in specified address will be the data
^*00	Pointer Dereference. Treat Intermediate Address as Data Register. Contents in specified address will be the data
!ACC	Register
:LABEL  Label as argument input

Data Types
==========
Data				D
RAM Address			P
ROM Address Label	L
 ROM Address int	L(ONLY USED FOR AND BY INTERRUPTS)

Arguments
=========
Register Arguments
  R		Any Register
  P		Address Register
  D		Data Register
------------------
Intermediate Arguments
  I		Intermediate Number
  A		Intermediate Address
----------------------
Misc/unsorted Arguments
  L		Label
  B		Boolean
-----------------------


Instructions
============
nop				No Operation
mov D/I D		Move Data from data register or intermediate number to register(Copy)
mov P/A P		Move Address from address register or intermediate address to register
swp D D			Swap data register values
swp P P			Swap address register values
jmp P/L			Jump to label or ROM Index Register(IDX and STL only)
slp D/I			Sleep (Differs from each implementation)
exb B			Set Execute Conditional Bool
sdf B			Set Defined Flag
inc R			Increment Register
dec R			Decrement Register
add D/I			Add ACC
sub D/I			Subtract ACC
mul D/I			Multiply ACC
div D/I			Divide ACC
neg				Toggle signed
not				NOT Bitwise on ACC
and D/I			AND Bitwise on ACC
orr D/I			OR Bitwise on ACC
xor D/I			XOR bitwise on ACC
lsf D/I			Left Shift ACC
rsf D/I			Right Shift ACC
psh P/A D/I		Push Stack. Address Register, Intermediate Address, Label Address and Value. Sets Execute Byte to FALSE if cannot push
psh R/I			Push Stack. Store current address and store value. Sets Execute Byte to FALSE if cannot push
pop				Pop Stack. Sets Execute Byte to FALSE if cannot pop
cal L			Store address to IDX then jump to label. If stacks are too complicated for you.
ret				Return/jump to IDX. If from an interrupt, return to Interrupt Address.
teq D/I D/I		Test Equality. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tgt D/I D/I		Test Greater Than. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tlt D/I D/I		Test Less Than. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tcp D/I D/I		Test Compare. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tdf B			Test Defined Flag. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
beq D/I D/I L	Branch on Equal
bgt D/I D/I L	Branch on Greater Than
blt D/I D/I L	Branch on Less Than
bcp D/I D/I L	Branch. Test Compare results.
bdf B L			Branch on Defined Flag.

Registers
=========
General Purpose Registers
  ACC	Accumulator[D]				All arithmethic and logic operations are done against it and also results stored.
  DAT	Data[D]						General purpose register.
----------------------------
Stack-Peeking Read Only Registers(READ-ONLY)
  STA	Top Stack Level Address[P]	Top level of stack is peeked here. Address
  STD	Top Stack Level Data[D]		Top level of stack is peeked here. Data
  STL   Top Stack Level Label[L]	Top level of stack is peeked here. Label
-----------------------------------------------
Index Registers
  IDX	Index[T]					Address oriented register store.
  IDA	Index A[P]					Address Register A
  IDB	Index B[P]					Address Register B
  INT	Interrupt Address[L(litrl)]	If interrupt is signalled, save current address to this register, and jump to label :INTERRUPT
------------------
Read-Only registers
  PRC	Program Counter[L(litrl)]	Shows current ROM address.
-------------------

Flags(Internal Use Only)
========================
EXECUTE_BOOL
IN_INTERRUPT


Intermediate Values
===================
Intermediate values are signed values ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
It is Int32 signed.


(Execute) Bool
==============
00 DEFAULT    Runs whichever execute bit is set to
01 TRUE       Runs instruction if execute bit and instruction's execute bit are equal
02 FALSE      Runs instruction if execute bit and instruction's execute bit are equal

This also applies to flags

# Execute bit is TRUE
+ nop # Runs
  nop # Runs
- nop # Will not run

# Execute bit is FALSE
+ nop # Will not run
  nop # Runs
- nop # Runs

The Execute Bit will never have the value of DEFAULT.
