pop				Pop Stack. Sets Execute Byte to FALSE if cannot pop
cal L			Store address to IDX then jump to label
ret				Return/jump to IDX
teq D/I D/I		Test Equality. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tgt D/I D/I		Test Greater Than. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tlt D/I D/I		Test Less Than. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tcp D/I D/I		Test Compare. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
tdf B			Test Defined Flag. Sets Execute Conditional Bool
beq D/I D/I P/A Branch on Equal
bgt D/I D/I P/A Branch on Greater Than
blt D/I D/I P/A Branch on Less Than
bcp D/I D/I P/A Branch. Test Compare results.
bdf B P/A		Branch on Defined Flag.


Registers
=========
General Purpose Registers[D]
  ACC	Accumulator					All arithmethic and logic operations are done against it and also results stored.
  DAT	Data						General purpose register.
----------------------------
Stack-Peeking Read Only Registers[P]
  STA	Top Stack Level Address		Top level of stack is peeked here.
  STD	Top Stack Level Data		Top level of stack is peeked here.
------------------------------------
Index Registers[P]
  IDX	Index						Address oriented register store.
  IDA	Index A						Address Register A
  IDB	Index B						Address Register B
  INT	Interrupt Address			If interrupt is signalled, save current address to this register, and jump to label :INTERRUPT
------------------
Read-Only registers
  PRC	Program Counter[P]				Shows current ROM address.
  CPI	Constant - Pi[D]				(Read Only register). Constant value of 3.1415926
----------------------



Intermediate Values
===================
Intermediate values are signed values ranging from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
It is Int32 signed.


(Execute) Bool
==============
00 DEFAULT    Runs whichever execute bit is set to
01 TRUE       Runs instruction if execute bit and instruction's execute bit are equal
02 FALSE      Runs instruction if execute bit and instruction's execute bit are equal

This also applies to flags

# Execute bit is TRUE
+ nop # Runs
  nop # Runs
- nop # Will not run

# Execute bit is FALSE
+ nop # Will not run
  nop # Runs
- nop # Runs

The Execute Bit will never have the value of DEFAULT.
