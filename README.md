# Amethyst-Virtual-Processor

// Programmed with luv. \~~kernels ♥♥♥


Embed this to your whatever! Amethyst bytecode is kind of primitive though. I HAVE no idea how proper bytecodes are done so bear with me. this is some dumb project

Though, this is a hastily written program, documentations, and etc. I want this finished by September... Because issues in real life(School starts in September. And no that isn't the reason). Probably won't be able to finish the rest of the projects I've started before September.

>*~~THIS IS A CRY FOR HELP~~* mn5cf2SSX0Q5AcF2Em70EPadN+IpivEY67S6EA7NWW5yCNP7ptKt1RiiDT6hA1t1wSVfQSDQERsI1+RYCv3ow7GZJ/l/IGcG

After waking up, I greet my IDE to start programming right away. Countless all-nighters and the occasional mental breakdown.. but whatever the troubles of getting to finish this. I think it will be all worth it.. I guess.

~~**EDIT**: Most of the time I've spent was actually napping~~

Hopefully it's useful..

### Todo list

Done:
 * Interpreter (in C)

~~Done~~:
 * Assembler (in C#)
 * Disassembler (in C#)

## Q/A
Though I don't think some weird trash written and designed in 2 days is something to be proud of... I guess I'll still add information about it. README wants to be filled in aswell, y know. ~~it gets lonely~~
#### What is the purpose of this?
Amethyst bytecode is supposed to be portable code. (Same program can be run on different machines)
If there is a small game/program that needs scripting. I/you can easily implement and port this. The parsing and interpreting is dead simple so it shouldn't be a problem with many programming languages. It's complexity isn't a problem aswell.

#### What is the assembly language?
The assembly language was first designed by me, but it really looks like Zachronics' syntax(Shenzhen IO and TIS 100). So I just copied the whole thing.
Parsing it aswell is very simple. All you need is spliting strings and converting them to bytes. It's not very complex. The only complex part is the JMP instruction.

#### ~~Do you like cupcakes?~~
~~Yes, I do. You pay me in cupcakes or headpats if you want me to do something for you~~
